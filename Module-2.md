Import the households dataset for your selected country and create a data frame with a variable that describes each of the following:


Below is a brief description in R of the original dataset and variables being used/processed:

Below is the processed dataset containing all information to be used in our analysis:

The response was to create a map that labelled administrative regions in the country of choice.  For me, I used data for Ghana.  Unfortunatley for this assignment Ghana has 260 separate districts and for the nature of the assignment I did not want to enlarge the picture to be big enough to read them all as the image would need to be huge.  Below is the output from the R script showing each district.
