##1) In the video Maroney details the way that ML is different from traditional programming.  In the traditional way, you create code and that code has rules that interpret data in a way to give you results.  However, in ML you have results and data to find rules.


The model predict function is the first result, which returns a 21.998814

model.fit(xs, ys, epochs=500)
print(model.predict([7.0]))

The above is the result from the 2nd iteration, which returns a result of 21.99073
The results are different depending on which iteration you run because it is a machine learning program, which means that with every iteration the model becomes optimized and learns in its own way.

Below is the results for the house price data

[3.00422, 2.3877, 3.620, 3.000, 1.7713, 2.3877]

Therefore the hugdins house is the best deal here, with a predicted price of about $238,770 and a actual price of less than half that.  Meanwhile the worst deal is the moon house, which has a price of about $75,000 over the model's predicted price
